Recently I have come across the game Petteia but after trying to play it I have found out that the game is not that interesting in its most usually presented form (board 8x8, 8 pieces for each player, rook movement, custodian capture, no jumps). And I'm not the only one who came to this conclusion. As many others I tried to figure out, what could be the missing rules, that would make the game interesting.
I think I have found a decent way to play Petteia while still keeping it simple and not creating too many additional assumptions. Even though my aim was to make a modern playable interpretation of Petteia I have found out that these rules quite fit into the Petteia and some Latrunculi descriptions.

If you are interested in the rules themselves, you can just skip my explanation part.

Two of the main problems in Petteia I found were:
1. Impenetrable row of pieces, which would make it impossible to make a single capture.
2. After some pieces are captured board becomes too big and pieces are too sparsely situated so that a piece can easily avoid capture.

Both situations make Petteia prone to draws and both of them result from a great advantage of defense over attack.
In order to fix this situation and after trying several approaches I have decided to differentiate an attacking move from a non-attacking move. Attacking move is the one which ends on an orthogonally adjacent field to an enemy piece. If a piece does not attack by its move, it is turned over. A turned piece cannot make other moves, except attacking ones. If a turned piece  takes part in a capture, it is turned back to normal. What’s the logic behind it and how does it help?
The logic is the following: pieces are brave greek soldiers. If a soldier does not attack, but moves with no purpose on the battlefield or even escapes from an attack, he can be called a deserter. A deserter is now under much stricter control and is forced to attack. To regain reputation a deserter should exterminate an enemy. In practice it means that an ordinary piece can make a non-attacking move only once. Defense no longer has such a great advantage and players are forced to play aggressively. A few test games showed that it is possible to play with these rules, though it will take some time to prove that it is really a playable game. Draw is still possible, but it will occur much less often as in usual rules.
Even though I wanted to create a modern playable version of Petteia, it turned out that it fits into old descriptions. For example the Isidor’s passage ("Calculi partim ordine moventur partim vage. Ideo alios ordinarios alios vagos appellant. At vero, qui moveri omnino non possunt incitos dicunt") divides pieces into “ordinarii” and “vagi”. In my description “ordinarii” are the ordinary pieces and “vagi” - the turned ones. It is interesting that the word “vagus” can mean “fugitive”, which makes sense in my rules. The “inciti” - the hopeless pieces are those “vagi” which can’t attack, thus having no available moves. Maybe the saying "citizen without a state may be compared to an isolated piece in a game of Petteia" also refers to such “inciti”?
Turning over the piece also does not contradict the archaeological evidence and was used in rules reconstruction by Ulrich Schaedler.
So the actual rules are following (I made them detailed enough not to have disputes over rules):

1. The game is played on a board 8x8 squares.
2. Players have 16 pieces each.
3. Players decide in random who moves first and then move in turn.
4. In the first phase of the game players put their pieces on any place on board in turn without any captures.
5. When all 32 pieces are on board, first phase is finished and the second phase starts.
6. In the second phase a turn consists in a move of one of the pieces according to the rules and possibly a capture of one or more enemy pieces.
7. A player can’t pass his turn. If a player can’t make a legal move, he loses.
8. Ordinary pieces (ordinarii) move as rooks in chess - any distance orthogonally to an empty space.
9. Pieces can’t jump one over another.
10. Square can be occupied by only one piece.
11. “Attack “ is a move which ends on a square orthogonally adjacent to an enemy piece.
12. If ordinary piece’s move is not an attack, this piece is turned over.
13. Turned pieces (vagi) move similarly to an ordinary piece, with a restriction that its move should always result in an attack. If turned piece can’t attack, it can’t move.
14. Capture is custodian.
15. It is possible to capture several pieces by a single move.
16. If a turned piece (vagus) takes part in a capture, it is turned back (becomes ordinarius).
17. A piece can voluntarily move between two enemy pieces with no harm.
18. A player who is left with a single piece on board loses.
19. In case there is a draw situation on board, player with more pieces wins. If they have the same number of pieces, player with more ordinarii wins. If they have the same number of ordinarii - then it’s a draw.

Few final notes:
By no means I claim that Greeks really played like this. But I will not reject this thought entirely. There should have been some missing rules, something not too obvious, because otherwise these rules would be used in other custodian-capture-games, but simple enough, that ancient authors did not pay attention to them much. I believe my rules fit into this category.
Probably it would make more sense to call this a “Latrunculi” reconstruction instead of a “Petteia”. I didn’t do so since Latrunculi now is usually associated with a Dux piece, which I did not use.
Regarding a passage from Shahnama about Nard, which is often used to justify having Dux on the field - I believe that Nard is a different game from Latrunculi. In particular I think that the game was played on an Alquerque board. The reason for this is the phrase “now they fought on the heights, now on the plains” - which may reflect the different points’ strength on the board. Even now in Fanorona, an Alquerque relative, 8-intersection points (“lakas”) are  associated with mountains.
