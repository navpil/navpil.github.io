# Scientific Naturalism: A Manifesto for Enlightened Humanism

Thanks to the world-view of scientific naturalism and Enlightenment humanism, never again need we be the intellectual slaves of those who would bind our minds with the chains of dogma and authority. 
In its stead we use reason and science as the arbiters of truth and knowledge. 
As I said in my 2012 Reason Rally speech before a crowd of over 20,000 humanists and science enthusiasts on the mall in Washington, DC:

 - Instead of divining truth through the authority of an ancient holy book or philosophical treatise, people began to explore the book of nature for themselves.
 - Instead of looking at illustrations in illuminated botanical books scholars went out into nature to see what was actually growing out of the ground.
 - Instead of relying on the woodcuts of dissected cadavers in old medical texts, physicians opened bodies themselves to see with their own eyes what was there.
 - Instead of human sacrifices to assuage the angry weather gods, naturalists made measurements of temperature, barometric pressure, and winds to create the meteorological sciences.
 - Instead of enslaving people because they were a lesser species, we expanded our knowledge to include all humans as members of the species through evolutionary sciences.
 - Instead of treating women as inferiors because a holy book says it is a manâ€™s right to do so, we discovered natural rights that dictate that all people should be treated equally through the moral sciences.
 - Instead of the supernatural belief in the divine right of kings, people employed a natural belief in the legal right of democracy, and this gave us political progress.
 - Instead of a tiny handful of elites holding most of the political power by keeping their citizens illiterate and unenlightened, through science, literacy, and education people could see for themselves the power and corruption that held them down and began to throw off their chains of bondage and demand their natural rights.

The constitutions of nations ought to be grounded in the constitution of humanity, which science and reason are best equipped to understand. That is the heart and core of scientific naturalism and Enlightenment humanism.
