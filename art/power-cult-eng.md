# The cult of power: the Russian paradigm

_Explanation of the hypocrisy, lies, cruelty, pride and other features inherent in the Russian culture by the Cult of Power, as the main paradigm of Russia._

## Introduction

There are different types of ethics — for example, those based on internal values (for example, Stoicism), others focus on the nature of actions, or on the nature of consequences (for example, the criminal code). 
There are religious ethics, such as Christian or Islamic, there are secular ones, such as Humanism.
The Russians rejected all these ethics and created their own - based on the Cult of Power.

> Whoever is strong is right.

### Direct examples

There are obvious direct examples of this cult.

It’s not a coincidence that the symbol of Russia is a bear - the strongest predatory animal of the northern forests.

War is an important part of the cult of power. 
Everything related to the army is adored. 
Russia sacralises the Second World War, and  instead of the European "never again", they "can do it again". 
They also call it differently - “Great Fatherland War” and start counting only since 1941, because otherwise they would have to accept Nazi-Soviet collaboration since 1939, which they are not willing to accept.

Characteristic statements and memes:

 - Second Army of the World (Russians were particularly proud of this fact)
 - The largest army of tanks
 - Sanctions? Don't make our Iskanders laugh (“Санции? Не смешите наши искандеры” - popular meme, there are T-shirts with this saying, Iskander being a kind of war machine)
 - “And we haven’t started anything yet” © Putin (Said after about 5 months after Russian invasion to Ukraine in 2022, meaning that there is much more power in Russia, than we think)

Russia does not consider it a bad thing to threaten the world with nuclear weapons, while showing off their power. 
From them you can hear a phrase like:

> We have nuclear weapons, you don't want to provoke a country with nuclear weapons.
> Or maybe a third world war will begin

A common russian saying as a wrap up: 

> You can’t really fight against a crowbar (Против лома нет приема)

### Reverse examples

Of course, if Russians love force, there are things they despise. 
This is the other, reverse side of the cult of power.

They feel contempt for democracy. 
After all, autocracy is better for them, which will be discussed later

They despise liberal values.
They call liberals "либерасты" - liberaste, which is a pun on words “liberal” and “pederaste” the latest often used in a derogatory meaning to label sexual minorities

They also dislike intelligence, which is usually associated with the weaker.
In Soviet Union according to a doctrine there should have been only two castes: workers and peasants (hence the Hammer and Sickle), intellectuals were considered a mere interlayer. 
Lev Tolstoy made fun of people who work with their head in his famous Fairy Tale About Fools. 
Intelligent people were often derogatory called “small shitty intelligent people” интелигентишка сраній or “bespectacled” - очкарик.

As is customary in societies that worship power, Russia also has a special dislike for sexual minorities. 
For some reason, this issue is so important to them that even Patriarch Kirill in his sermon on March 6, 2022, on Forgiven Sunday, chose the gay parade as the main topic of conversation. 
“Gay propaganda” is officially forbidden in Russia. 
Such fanatical homophobia is mistakenly perceived by Russians for love for traditional values.

In addition to direct and reverse examples, there are other manifestations of the cult of power. 
This includes the attitude towards other people or nations, in particular:

- Servility to the ones who are stronger
- Contempt to the ones who are weaker
- Cynicism to the equals

These and other topics will be discussed later.

## Power Vertical

"Power Vertical" is an often heard slogan of modern russian politics.
This implies a "strong hand" which rules the ones who should obey.
Next the relations between the weaker and the stronger are explained.  

### Servility

Called “раболепие” (rabolepie) in Russian, which combines words Slave and Adorement and might be translated as “Adorement by Slaves”.
Combines slave psychology with subservience in relation to authority figures.

The following statements are typical of people infected with servility:

 - I am a small person (я человек маленький)
 - What can I do (а что я могу сделать)
 - It's hard for the common man to understand (простому человеку сложно разобраться)
 - Giraffe is big - he sees better (жираф - большой, ему - видней) - these are words from Vysotski song, which are sometimes used in a somewhat self-ironic way
 - smart people are sitting there, they know better (там умные люди сидят, им лучше знать) - similar phrases are said about officials when their authority or decisions are questions by someone outside

Probably, this behavior is caused by learned helplessness. 
It arises due to the inability to control one's life, as well as the relativity of rules.
