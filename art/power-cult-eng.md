# The cult of power: the Russian paradigm

_Explanation of the hypocrisy, lies, cruelty, pride and other features inherent in the Russian culture by the Cult of Power, as the main paradigm of Russia._

## Introduction

There are different types of ethics — for example, those based on internal values (for example, Stoicism), others focus on the nature of actions, or on the nature of consequences (for example, the criminal code). 
There are religious ethics, such as Christian or Islamic, there are secular ones, such as Humanism.
The Russians rejected all these ethics and created their own - based on the Cult of Power.

> Whoever is strong is right.

### Direct examples

There are obvious direct examples of this cult.

It’s not a coincidence that the symbol of Russia is a bear - the strongest predatory animal of the northern forests.

War is an important part of the cult of power. 
Everything related to the army is adored. 
Russia sacralises the Second World War, and  instead of the European "never again", they "can do it again". 
They also call it differently - “Great Fatherland War” and start counting only since 1941, because otherwise they would have to accept Nazi-Soviet collaboration since 1939, which they are not willing to accept.

Characteristic statements and memes:

 - Second Army of the World (Russians were particularly proud of this fact)
 - The largest army of tanks
 - Sanctions? Don't make our Iskanders laugh (“Санции? Не смешите наши искандеры” - popular meme, there are T-shirts with this saying, Iskander being a kind of war machine)
 - “And we haven’t started anything yet” © Putin (Said after about 5 months after Russian invasion to Ukraine in 2022, meaning that there is much more power in Russia, than we think)

Russia does not consider it a bad thing to threaten the world with nuclear weapons, while showing off their power. 
From them you can hear a phrase like:

> We have nuclear weapons, you don't want to provoke a country with nuclear weapons.
> Or maybe a third world war will begin

A common russian saying as a wrap up: 

> You can’t really fight against a crowbar (Против лома нет приема)

### Reverse examples

Of course, if Russians love force, there are things they despise. 
This is the other, reverse side of the cult of power.

They feel contempt for democracy. 
After all, autocracy is better for them, which will be discussed later

They despise liberal values.
They call liberals "либерасты" - liberaste, which is a pun on words “liberal” and “pederaste” the latest often used in a derogatory meaning to label sexual minorities

They also dislike intelligence, which is usually associated with the weaker.
In Soviet Union according to a doctrine there should have been only two castes: workers and peasants (hence the Hammer and Sickle), intellectuals were considered a mere interlayer. 
Lev Tolstoy made fun of people who work with their head in his famous Fairy Tale About Fools. 
Intelligent people were often derogatory called “small shitty intelligent people” интелигентишка сраній or “bespectacled” - очкарик.

As is customary in societies that worship power, Russia also has a special dislike for sexual minorities. 
For some reason, this issue is so important to them that even Patriarch Kirill in his sermon on March 6, 2022, on Forgiven Sunday, chose the gay parade as the main topic of conversation. 
“Gay propaganda” is officially forbidden in Russia. 
Such fanatical homophobia is mistakenly perceived by Russians for love for traditional values.

In addition to direct and reverse examples, there are other manifestations of the cult of power. 
This includes the attitude towards other people or nations, in particular:

- Servility to the ones who are stronger
- Contempt to the ones who are weaker
- Cynicism to the equals

These and other topics will be discussed later.

## Power Vertical

"Power Vertical" is an often heard slogan of modern russian politics.
This implies a "strong hand" which rules the ones who should obey.
Next the relations between the weaker and the stronger are explained.  

### Servility

Called “раболепие” (rabolepie) in Russian, which combines words Slave and Adorement and might be translated as “Adorement by Slaves”.
Combines slave psychology with subservience in relation to authority figures.

The following statements are typical of people infected with servility:

 - I am a small person (я человек маленький)
 - What can I do (а что я могу сделать)
 - It's hard for the common man to understand (простому человеку сложно разобраться)
 - Giraffe is big - he sees better (жираф - большой, ему - видней) - these are words from Vysotski song, which are sometimes used in a somewhat self-ironic way
 - smart people are sitting there, they know better (там умные люди сидят, им лучше знать) - similar phrases are said about officials when their authority or decisions are questions by someone outside

Probably, this behavior is caused by learned helplessness. 
It arises due to the inability to control one's life, as well as the relativity of rules. 

### Autocracy and Tsarism

Directly related to Servility. 
Autocracy is the basis of the Russian style of government for more than four hundred years, or maybe longer. 
In 1654 during negotiating the "Eternal Peace" between Ukraine and Russia 
there was a conflict between Khmelnitsky (Ukrainian leader) and the Russian ambassadors 
because the Moscow tsar was an autocrat and refused to swear an oath to anyone.
Autocracy, or Tsarism - the russian form of autocracy, means a single person rules the state. 
In essence, it is a form of absolute monarchy.

It is believed that

> tsar-father knows everything (царь-батюшка все знает)

This is how the Russians think:

> If tsar wants so, then it must be so. 
> If no logical reasons are visible, then we do not know everything. 
> The king is wise, you have to trust him.
> 
> If Putin decided to attack Ukraine, then he is a strategic genius. 
> If he says that Ukraine itself wanted to attack Russia, then it is so. 
> If there is no evidence of this - no problem, Putin definitely has such evidence.
> Because he knows what is he doing.

Autocracy together with Servility give rise to such phenomena as:
 
 - Hard centralization (power vertical)
 - Lack of dignity
 - Suppression of personality
 - Lack of initiative
 
Regarding the last point, there is no initiative even in such things as playing sports. 
It is intertwined with cynicism and alcoholism. 
Because "it's better to drink vodka."

Due to autocracy, authoritarianism and lack of initiative, the Russian army cannot be decentralized, as the Armed Forces of Ukraine are. 
And the volunteer movement is impossible in Russia to the same extent, as in Ukraine. 
The Maidans (collective name for Ukrainian revolutions of 2004 and 2013) is also impossible, 
therefore Russians believe that the Maidans' participants in Ukraine were paid for.

### Pride

Russians look down on all the weaker ones. 

Their pride can be mixed with condescension, as it once was towards Ukrainians.
For instance Russians called Ukrainians _younger brothers_, and considered Ukrainians nice, but a bit stupid.

Or their pride can be mixed with disdain, like towards the Americans.
The often repeated quote of a pretty popular stand up comic Zadornov about Americans is

> But they are stu-u-upid (да они же тупы-ы-ые)

Anyway, since they have the second army in the world, they can despise all other weaker nations.
They still can despise the USA, which has the first army in the world, because of the USA's love for such "weak" things as liberalism or democracy.

The pride of Russia and Russians is manifested as follows:

 - messianism (being a chosen nation, bringing "Russian peace" and "Russian culture" to the world)
 - the Third Rome (in the order Rome-Constantinople-Moscow - popular idea that after Rome and Konstantinopol fell, Moscow is now as important as they were)
 - chauvinism (russian form of nazism)
 - phrases like "we are to be loved or feared"
 - pride for Great Russia

Regarding the last point. 
If we analyze the anthem of Russia, there are no actions that the person can do except for "being proud", specifically in the chorus:

> glory to the country, we are proud of you (славсья страна, мы гордимся тобой)

Compare that to Ukrainian anthem:

> ...And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own.   
> We'll lay down our souls and bodies to attain our freedom,  
> And we'll show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation!  

Such passivity of the russian anthem singer is perfectly combined with the already mentioned autocracy and servitude.

All this together leads to imperialism, since all the other nations, in the Russian opinion, are less worthy to have their own state. 
Hence the dislike for Georgia, the Baltic countries, Ukraine, disdain for the Central Asian republics and the desire to restore the USSR.

### Cruelty

Cruelty is a direct result of the cult of strength, pride and contempt for the weak. 
If the weaker one could not stand up for himself, then, from the point of view of the cult of power, he himself is to blame. 

Pride and cynicism (discussed later) combine to produce a lack of compassion.

This leads to such phenomena as:

 - rape
 - torture
 - inflicting severe injuries

The Russian military admitted that they

> We kill civilians for fun (нам по приколу убивать цивильных)

Another example of cruelty is the Russian book "Household" (Домострой) — a book on household management. 
The man in this book was an absolute autocrat in his house. 
And the book describes how to beat a woman so that she obeys. 
This book could be called a relic of the Middle Ages, but nothing has changed in Russia.

Russian sayings about cruelty follow:

- He beats means he loves (бьет значит любит)
- People wouldn't like you forcefully (насильно мил не будешь)

Even though the second saying is true, it would not arise in the culture where people want others 
to like them by using force.
This resonates with Russian wish "to be loved or to be feared". 

## Cynicism

Stronger should be treated with servility and obedience. 
Weaker should be treated with cruelty and disdain.
What about equal? 
They are neither stronger nor weaker, and it is not entirely clear how to treat them according to the Power Vertical. 

In such relationships, indifference and cynicism prevail among Russians. 
Russians are cynical not only with other equals, they are cynical with themselves.

In less educated segments of the population, such a cynical attitude towards oneself and the environment develops into alcoholism. 
After all, in the absence of initiative and other values, except for the cult of power, the only thing left is to abuse alcohol.

Among intellectuals, such a cynicism becomes a specifically Russian postmodernism. 
They reject all values and question everything, but they do it in a sophisticated manner. 
This is what Russian liberals do. 
They, for example, want to be above war, perceive it as some kind of misunderstanding, they have nothing to do with it, they are for peace. 
And in general, according to them, war and politics are a dirty business, it is not yet clear who is right and who is guilty.

Russians treat each other indifferently and cynically, they do not see value in each other. 
That is why collectivity in Russia can only be forced. 
All attempts to unite the team are seen as something foreign. 
This leads to a lack of voluntary cooperation. 
It is organically connected with authoritarianism, centralization and autocracy.

There is a russian common saying to justify their cynicism:

> It's not that we are bad, it's just that life is like that (не мы такие, жизнь такая)

Other cynical quotes are:

> Women will give birth to more of them (бабы еще нарожают)

...as a refusal to protect the lives of military personnel.

Or check out this Putin's answer when asked about what happened to Kursk submarine, where about 100 people died:

> It drowned (она утонула)

Russian cynicism would be incomplete without a mention of an almost fundamental Russian trait. 
I'm talking about lying.

## Lies, lies, lies

The built into humans reluctance to obey, along with the need to do so, leads to hypocrisy and lies.
This is because one cannot openly tell what he thinks in an authoritarian society.
Russians are used to tell one thing and think another.
Russians are used to behave as they are supposed to, but do it with some inner reluctance.
There was a common joke in a USSR:

> They pretend that they pay us, and we pretend that we do the work

Lying and pretending is a common trait in russian culture.

### Self-contradiction

This double thinking is so normal to Russians, that they don't even notice, when they contradict themselves in the same sentence.
For instance here are roughly translated quotes from a great article in russian [Enter the darkness and find people there](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/04/24/voyti-vo-mrak-i-naschupat-v-nem-lyudey).
I give some explanation in square quotes.

> Everyone [on the West] is happy that they could make one nation* to fight against itself.
> They simply wanted Russia to be weak.
> We had no other choice [than to attack Ukraine].  
> *_some russians consider Ukrainians and russians being one nation_

> I have changed rubles to dollars today. 
> Everything will be fine. 
> Soon we will cut ourselves off the dollar and will live happily.

> Young people are being pushed into all this – into fascism and into the belief that the war should not continue.

> "We have a normal attitude towards Ukrainians, right?"
> "_But you said that Ukrainians should be punished_"
> "That's right! They should be punished!"

> "Same as USA with its states, let us all be together: Ukraine, Chuvashia, but all together, fraternal peoples, like, roughly speaking, the USSR with the republics."
> "_Don't you think that Ukraine is a sovereign state?_"
> "I believe that Donetsk and Lugansk* are a sovereign state.
> They have expressed their independence - so give them independence.
> Why don't you give?!"  
> *_Since 2014 occupied by russian forces, self-proclaimed DNR and LNR_

### Russians lies

Russians consider others to be just as cynical, so they don't think that lying is something bad, because in their opinion everyone lies

For example, there is a whole new word "Ихтамнеты" (Ikhtamnety) - which roughly can be translated as They-aren't-theres (noun in plural).
When russian soldiers occupied Crimea in 2014 they did it without russian identification signs.
Russian government lied, when asked about russian soldiers in Crimea: "They are not there", их там нет in russian.
So russian soldiers were called Polite People (вежливые люди), Green Humans (зеленые человечки) or They-aren't-there's (ихтамнеты).

As for more modern examples, Russians officially say that Bucha massacre is a western fake.
But in between themselves they are happy about the massacre and claim that 

> We will make Bucha from Lviv to Kharkiv (сделаем Бучу от Львова до Харькова)

...with Lviv and Kharkiv being large cities on the West and East of Ukraine.

Modern russians try to deny the existence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Or they rarely know about it.
Second World War started in 1941 for them, because according to the Pact, there was a cooperation between nazis and commies.
And russian government does not want to admit to that fact.

The goals of "special war operation 2022" have changed several times:
- Demilitarization and Denazification
- Protection of the people of Donbass
- So that NATO does not reach the borders
- Protect poor Ukrainians from the Kyiv regime

Apparently the goal is to simply destroy Ukraine, but they'd better lie about something than clearly admit that.

By attacking Ukraine, russians say that they "liberate them" (мы их освобождаем).
People in Ukraine react with dark humor on this phrase, like "russians liberated me from my leg" or 
"russians liberated me from my flat".

As for shelling of Ukrainian cities, russians say that 

> Ukrainians bomb themselves, we only shoot at military targets

...which is particularly unconvincing if to remember what happened to Mariupol, heavily shelled by russian armed forces.

Russians bombed Odesa port the day after the signing of the grain export agreement.
This demonstrates how much are the pieces of paper signed by Russia worth.

The most famous paper signed by russia for Ukrainians is a Budapest Memorandum.
For those who don't know - Ukraine gave all of the atomic weapons to russia.
Russia (together with USA and UK) promised to protect Ukraine from any sovereignty violations.

Russians claim that "Nazis are in power in Ukraine", although they cannot provide any evidence. 
Even in the article ["What Russia should do with Ukraine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Russia_Should_Do_with_Ukraine), which describes how the genocide of Ukrainians should proceed, they modestly write that:
> The peculiarity of modern nazified Ukraine is in amorphousness and ambivalence, which allow Nazism to be disguised as a desire for “independence” and a “European” (Western, pro-American) path of “development” (in reality, to degradation), to assert that in Ukraine “there is no Nazism , only private individual excesses”. 
> After all, there is no main Nazi party, no Fuhrer, no full-fledged racial laws (only their truncated version in the form of repressions against the Russian language). 
> As a result, there is no opposition and resistance to the regime.

Lavrov (russian minister of foreign affairs) famously said 

> “But we didn’t attack Ukraine either”

Their war slogans also appear to be lies:

> We don't leave ours (своих не бросаем) - they proved it wrong many times during the 2022 war

> Russia does not start wars, but ends them (Россия войны не начинает, она их заканчивает)

Russians are so predictable in their lying that four stages of denying unpleasant facts can be distinguished:
1. There were no explosions
2. There were explosions, but it wasn't us
3. It was us, but we hit military facilities
4. We did not hit the military objects, but “Where were you for eight years while the Donbass was bombed?”

Many times during Russian invasion into Ukraine russians went through the four above-mentioned stages.
For instance Mariupol theatre.

Russia is so soaked in lies that appearance is more important to it than reality. 
Almost all areas of life are divided into sales and internal.
- Russian athletes are cool, but Russians don't play sports
- Russian artists are cool, but Russians most often drink vodka and don't care
- Russian scientists may be cool, but Russian engineers cannot explain what a logarithm is

The whole myth of Great Russian Culture is because they can sell what is cool, but they don't practice it themselves.
How do you think - what percentage of russians actually like ballet and read Lev Tolstoy's "War and Peace"?

I will complete this section with typical russian sayings:

> Life is bad without a person to fool (без лоха и жизнь плоха)
> You don't fool - you don't survive (не наебешь - не проживешь)
> Who's not caught is not a thief (не пойман - не вор)

My favourite one is "And you prove!" ("а вы докажите!").
It is often used when caught lying, but the evidence is not enough. 
Related to the saying "Who's not caught is not a thief".
