# The cult of power: the Russian paradigm

_Explanation of the hypocrisy, lies, cruelty, pride and other features inherent in the Russian culture by the Cult of Power, as the main paradigm of Russia._

## Introduction

There are different types of ethics — for example, those based on internal values (for example, Stoicism), others focus on the nature of actions, or on the nature of consequences (for example, the criminal code). 
There are religious ethics, such as Christian or Islamic, there are secular ones, such as Humanism.
The Russians rejected all these ethics and created their own - based on the Cult of Power.

> Whoever is strong is right.

### Direct examples

There are obvious direct examples of this cult.

It’s not a coincidence that the symbol of Russia is a bear - the strongest predatory animal of the northern forests.

War is an important part of the cult of power. 
Everything related to the army is adored. 
Russia sacralises the Second World War, and  instead of the European "never again", they "can do it again". 
They also call it differently - “Great Fatherland War” and start counting only since 1941, because otherwise they would have to accept Nazi-Soviet collaboration since 1939, which they are not willing to accept.

Characteristic statements and memes:

 - Second Army of the World (Russians were particularly proud of this fact)
 - The largest army of tanks
 - Sanctions? Don't make our Iskanders laugh (“Санции? Не смешите наши искандеры” - popular meme, there are T-shirts with this saying, Iskander being a kind of war machine)
 - “And we haven’t started anything yet” © Putin (Said after about 5 months after Russian invasion to Ukraine in 2022, meaning that there is much more power in Russia, than we think)

Russia does not consider it a bad thing to threaten the world with nuclear weapons, while showing off their power. 
From them you can hear a phrase like:

> We have nuclear weapons, you don't want to provoke a country with nuclear weapons.
> Or maybe a third world war will begin

A common russian saying as a wrap up: 

> You can’t really fight against a crowbar (Против лома нет приема)

### Reverse examples

Of course, if Russians love force, there are things they despise. 
This is the other, reverse side of the cult of power.

They feel contempt for democracy. 
After all, autocracy is better for them, which will be discussed later

They despise liberal values.
They call liberals "либерасты" - liberaste, which is a pun on words “liberal” and “pederaste” the latest often used in a derogatory meaning to label sexual minorities

They also dislike intelligence, which is usually associated with the weaker.
In Soviet Union according to a doctrine there should have been only two castes: workers and peasants (hence the Hammer and Sickle), intellectuals were considered a mere interlayer. 
Lev Tolstoy made fun of people who work with their head in his famous Fairy Tale About Fools. 
Intelligent people were often derogatory called “small shitty intelligent people” интелигентишка сраній or “bespectacled” - очкарик.

As is customary in societies that worship power, Russia also has a special dislike for sexual minorities. 
For some reason, this issue is so important to them that even Patriarch Kirill in his sermon on March 6, 2022, on Forgiven Sunday, chose the gay parade as the main topic of conversation. 
“Gay propaganda” is officially forbidden in Russia. 
Such fanatical homophobia is mistakenly perceived by Russians for love for traditional values.

In addition to direct and reverse examples, there are other manifestations of the cult of power. 
This includes the attitude towards other people or nations, in particular:

- Servility to the ones who are stronger
- Contempt to the ones who are weaker
- Cynicism to the equals

These and other topics will be discussed later.

## Power Vertical

"Power Vertical" is an often heard slogan of modern russian politics.
This implies a "strong hand" which rules the ones who should obey.
Next the relations between the weaker and the stronger are explained.  

### Servility

Called “раболепие” (rabolepie) in Russian, which combines words Slave and Adorement and might be translated as “Adorement by Slaves”.
Combines slave psychology with subservience in relation to authority figures.

The following statements are typical of people infected with servility:

 - I am a small person (я человек маленький)
 - What can I do (а что я могу сделать)
 - It's hard for the common man to understand (простому человеку сложно разобраться)
 - Giraffe is big - he sees better (жираф - большой, ему - видней) - these are words from Vysotski song, which are sometimes used in a somewhat self-ironic way
 - smart people are sitting there, they know better (там умные люди сидят, им лучше знать) - similar phrases are said about officials when their authority or decisions are questions by someone outside

Probably, this behavior is caused by learned helplessness. 
It arises due to the inability to control one's life, as well as the relativity of rules. 

### Autocracy and Tsarism

Directly related to Servility. 
Autocracy is the basis of the Russian style of government for more than four hundred years, or maybe longer. 
In 1654 during negotiating the "Eternal Peace" between Ukraine and Russia 
there was a conflict between Khmelnitsky (Ukrainian leader) and the Russian ambassadors 
because the Moscow tsar was an autocrat and refused to swear an oath to anyone.
Autocracy, or Tsarism - the russian form of autocracy, means a single person rules the state. 
In essence, it is a form of absolute monarchy.

It is believed that

> tsar-father knows everything (царь-батюшка все знает)

This is how the Russians think:

> If tsar wants so, then it must be so. 
> If no logical reasons are visible, then we do not know everything. 
> The king is wise, you have to trust him.
> 
> If Putin decided to attack Ukraine, then he is a strategic genius. 
> If he says that Ukraine itself wanted to attack Russia, then it is so. 
> If there is no evidence of this - no problem, Putin definitely has such evidence.
> Because he knows what is he doing.

Autocracy together with Servility give rise to such phenomena as:
 
 - Hard centralization (power vertical)
 - Lack of dignity
 - Suppression of personality
 - Lack of initiative
 
Regarding the last point, there is no initiative even in such things as playing sports. 
It is intertwined with cynicism and alcoholism. 
Because "it's better to drink vodka."

Due to autocracy, authoritarianism and lack of initiative, the Russian army cannot be decentralized, as the Armed Forces of Ukraine are. 
And the volunteer movement is impossible in Russia to the same extent, as in Ukraine. 
The Maidans (collective name for Ukrainian revolutions of 2004 and 2013) is also impossible, 
therefore Russians believe that the Maidans' participants in Ukraine were paid for.

### Pride

Russians look down on all the weaker ones. 

Their pride can be mixed with condescension, as it once was towards Ukrainians.
For instance Russians called Ukrainians _younger brothers_, and considered Ukrainians nice, but a bit stupid.

Or their pride can be mixed with disdain, like towards the Americans.
The often repeated quote of a pretty popular stand up comic Zadornov about Americans is

> But they are stu-u-upid (да они же тупы-ы-ые)

Anyway, since they have the second army in the world, they can despise all other weaker nations.
They still can despise the USA, which has the first army in the world, because of the USA's love for such "weak" things as liberalism or democracy.

The pride of Russia and Russians is manifested as follows:

 - messianism (being a chosen nation, bringing "Russian peace" and "Russian culture" to the world)
 - the Third Rome (in the order Rome-Constantinople-Moscow - popular idea that after Rome and Konstantinopol fell, Moscow is now as important as they were)
 - chauvinism (russian form of nazism)
 - phrases like "we are to be loved or feared"
 - pride for Great Russia

Regarding the last point. 
If we analyze the anthem of Russia, there are no actions that the person can do except for "being proud", specifically in the chorus:

> glory to the country, we are proud of you (славсья страна, мы гордимся тобой)

Compare that to Ukrainian anthem:

> ...And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own.   
> We'll lay down our souls and bodies to attain our freedom,  
> And we'll show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation!  

Such passivity of the russian anthem singer is perfectly combined with the already mentioned autocracy and servitude.

All this together leads to imperialism, since all the other nations, in the Russian opinion, are less worthy to have their own state. 
Hence the dislike for Georgia, the Baltic countries, Ukraine, disdain for the Central Asian republics and the desire to restore the USSR.

### Cruelty

Cruelty is a direct result of the cult of strength, pride and contempt for the weak. 
If the weaker one could not stand up for himself, then, from the point of view of the cult of power, he himself is to blame. 

Pride and cynicism (discussed later) combine to produce a lack of compassion.

This leads to such phenomena as:

 - rape
 - torture
 - inflicting severe injuries

The Russian military admitted that they

> We kill civilians for fun (нам по приколу убивать цивильных)

Another example of cruelty is the Russian book "Household" (Домострой) — a book on household management. 
The man in this book was an absolute autocrat in his house. 
And the book describes how to beat a woman so that she obeys. 
This book could be called a relic of the Middle Ages, but nothing has changed in Russia.

Russian sayings about cruelty follow:

- He beats means he loves (бьет значит любит)
- People wouldn't like you forcefully (насильно мил не будешь)

Even though the second saying is true, it would not arise in the culture where people want others 
to like them by using force.
This resonates with Russian wish "to be loved or to be feared".
