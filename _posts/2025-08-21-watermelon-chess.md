Watermelon Chess or Xi Gua Qi is a simple blocking game. Players capture opponent pieces by surrounding them from all sides.

This game feels like an expanded version of a Horseshoe and is also somewhat similar to Hobag Gonu. It's a game for children but it's more complex than Tic Tac Toe. The way it is intended to be played is to draw a board with a chalk on a ground, play few rounds with pebbles and then move on to other activities.

When played seriously the game may become a stalemate already after each player have made their first move. This happens if any of the players move their central pieces one step forth, and then starts moving the back pieces (unreachable for an opponent) around. Mechanics of the game does not allow to break another player defense, unless he goes offensive himself. Even if both players become offensive and capture few pieces each, it's hard to end the game unless one player makes a mistake.

This game may be fun for children under age of 10. But I'd rather teach them playing checkers.

The board looks mysterious and lures the players, but the gameplay is quite disappointing for adults. If you like the board and want to make use of it, I may suggest playing [thing=39614]Sz'Kwa[/thing] instead.
