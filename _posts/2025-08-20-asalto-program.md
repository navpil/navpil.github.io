After not being able to find any program to play "Asalto" or "Officers and Sepoys" against computer I wrote one myself.

It's called "Fox, Geese & Co" and includes several games - including Asalto, Fox and Geese, Officers and Sepoys (Asalto on large board) and others. It's highly configurable. You can select which restrictions apply for geese movement, how many pieces are there on board, who goes first, is capture mandatory, how strong the computer opponent is, etc. All options are described on the program's [About page](https://navpil.github.io/games/asalto/about-en.html)

It's free of charge and provided "as is". AI is not perfect, but provides enough challenge. I'm not a frontend developer, neither I'm a designer. It's possible that it may work incorrectly sometimes, though I tried to test it as much as I could. 

You can try it by this link (free of charge and of adverts):
