title: Ukraine as a messenger of peace in the world

Why Ukraine’s position is unique and how we can use it to bring peace to the world (a translation of my Ukrainian article Україна, як посол миру в світі)

Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. 
Western and not only Western countries started actively helping Ukraine. 
But at the same time, some nations complained that other world conflicts are not given so much attention. 
Why Ukraine, they ask? 
Why not Syria, Yemen or Palestine? 
In this they see the Western hypocrisy, and even racism. 
There is an answer to their question. 
And there is also a certain opportunity for Ukraine, which we can use after the victory over Russia.

First with the answer. 
In fact, the West reacted rather sluggishly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. 
Back then the war was conducted by hybrid means and was disguised as a civil war. 
The problems in Syria and Yemen also look like civil conflicts, even if one suspects that they are proxy conflicts. 
That is — wars that look like a war between two local sides, but in reality it is a war between the United States and Russia, or Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
In such conflicts, it is not so easy to directly support a side. 
This could lead to a new Vietnam or Iraq.

Ukraine is also outraged by the Western reaction on the events in 2014. 
In 2022, everything changed, because Russia went to war openly, and without provocations from the Ukrainian side. 
And such wars, where one state (nuclear) so blatantly attacks the neighbouring one (non-nuclear) are nowhere to be seen right now. 
In addition, Russia threatens other European states, so the so called collective West has a vested interest in stopping Russia in Ukraine.

And now about the opportunity for Ukraine. 
After this war, Ukraine can become a messenger of peace in the world. 
And I am convinced it should. 
In fact, all those who are now outraged by the hypocrisy of the West should hope that Ukraine will win. 
And that Ukraine will start defending their rights. 
Why so? 
Ukraine also suffered from Western hypocrisy. 
That’s all the flirting with Russia, when we were shedding blood in the east. 
Nord Stream 2, increasing dependence on Russian gas, “realpolitik” where the interests of money and business are more important than human lives. 
Ukraine also saw that the UN was not working as expected. 
The humorous Twitter account “Is EU concerned” is a creation of Ukraine.

Ukraine has now introduced honesty into world politics. 
Pay attention to the harsh statements of our diplomats to Western partners, as an example — the refusal to the German president to visit Ukraine [1]. 
It was this kind of honesty that was lacking in the world. 
But despite this, there are other things which make Ukraine unique.

We abandoned the third largest nuclear potential in the world. 
Isn’t the whole world striving for nuclear disarmament? 
Are we not an example? 
To be fair, we are not the only state that has renounced nuclear status, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Belarus did it too. 
Unfortunately, the latter renounced its nuclear-free status and took part in the aggression of 2022.

Unlike many European countries, we do not have a colonial past like France, Britain or Belgium.

Ukrainians perfectly understand what it is like to be oppressed. 
We understand what it’s like when your culture or language is banned and when your land is ruled by cruel foreigners.

Ukraine did not wage colonial wars and was never an empire.

In Ukraine, there is complete religious freedom. 
In our country, the church and atheism coexist peacefully.

In addition, a Muslim minority — the Crimean Tatars — live peacefully in Ukraine. 
We are of different ethnicity, languages, religion and history. 
Nevertheless, there are no ethnic or religious conflicts. 
We can be an example for Europe, where there are also Islamic minorities. 
But we can also use it as a trump card in resolving conflicts in the East. 
It will be much easier for Muslim delegations to convince other Muslims for peace.

Ukraine has one of the lowest levels of anti-Semitism in Europe. 
In addition, Jews can often be seen in government offices, and not only it rarely bothers anyone, but in fact very few are interested in it at all.

Ukraine does not threaten any country with a military invasion. 
We are not a conquering state.

Nevertheless, and we have already proved it, we know what the struggle for freedom is. 
We are not passive spectators. 
We know what war is. 
And we cannot be accused of being wealthy Europeans who do not know what they are talking about when we talk about military conflicts and their termination.

As a summary for all the above, we can confidently say that we are one of the most peaceful nations in the world. 
We understand the problems of many nations. 
Unlike many of the the Western countries, and also unlike Russia, we do not have any colonialistic past and we know what being oppressed is. 
We can become a messenger of peace in the world. 
And I am glad that the U24 alternative is coming out of our government, which offers another security alternative to the UN [2]. 
I really want this framework to work.

I also want, and I am sure, that Ukraine can take part in the settlement of conflicts. 
We have good, or at least neutral, relations with almost all countries in the world, including the USA and China, which can help us in our peace mission. 
Our only real enemy now is Russia. 
And if Russia tried to build a bipolar world, Ukraine can become the glue between East and West, between North and South. 
And at the same time, not pulling the blanket over ourselves, do not trying to become a separate independent “pole”. 
And, this is my humble hope, after our victory, Russia will change its rhetoric. 
In a few years, they will realize their mistakes. 
And maybe the world will finally get rid of Russian lies and propaganda and it will be possible to look honestly at the conflicts. 
And not as it is now — if the USA is on one side, then Russia will definitely side with the others.

Ukraine cannot lose its honesty. 
We must condemn the things that call for condemnation, regardless of who did it. 
Maybe we need to reconsider the bombing of Belgrade, take an honest look at Palestine, publicly condemn the US invasion of Iraq. 
Accept not the side that we like, but the one that is right.

I am not naive, sometimes conflicts cannot be resolved simply. 
But I am sure that people have a brain that we can use to think. 
Or a soul, if you prefer, which can show us the right way. 
People can talk and, I’m sure, can negotiate. 
On the other side the hard stance should be taken against destructive wars and genocides, no matter who initiates them. 
And Ukraine can take part in all of this. 
If we want to make the world a better place to live in, we can try. 
We must seize the moment while the whole world is on our side.

But first we must win.
