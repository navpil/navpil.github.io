# Solitaires

Solitaires are games for one person. Solitaire games with Chinese dominoes can be divided into two groups. The first use classic triplets. Others are limited to classic pairs. 

Solitaires using classic triplets are much more interesting, because in such games the same tile can belong to different triplets and you have to think about where to use it. Such games include: 

 - [Clearing the Rows](/gupai/solitaires/guo-wu-guan.html) 
 - [Game of Zen](/gupai/solitaires/zen.html) 
 - [Eight trigrams](/gupai/solitaires/eight-trigrams.html) 

The second type of solitaire uses only pairs and the choice of how to use the tiles is obvious. Accordingly, these games are much simpler, I devoted only one page to them. I also included a memory game among solitaires, but in fact it can be played by two or even three people.
