After reading your article I came up with some layman terms for explaining the uncertainty principle.

Say - I want to buy an interesting book which looks good. The more picky I’m about a subject (I want it to be about medieval bee-keeping), the less certain I can be whether I will like the book’s appearance. The more picky I’m about appearance (I want it to be exactly 10x15 inches, hardcover, green) the less certain I can be that the subject will be interesting for me. This is a book subject-appearance uncertainty principle. I can measure both after I buy the book, though.

Is it a good enough explanation for people alien to the quantum mechanics?
