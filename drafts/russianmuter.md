# From a Russian speaker to a Russian muter

Very personal article - about my life experience


Language was never an issue for me - actually I enjoyed learning new languages as long as I had time for that.


Now when I speak with native Russians I paradoxically use English - that's how the "defending of a Russian language" went in Ukraine. Country with the second largest population of Russian speakers is slowly becoming Russian-mute.
