# From a Russian speaker to a Russian muter

Very personal article - about my life experience


Language was never an issue for me - actually I enjoyed learning new languages as long as I had time for that.

Russian language is not about

> Мороз и солнце, день чудесный

a Pushkin's poem which I used to know by heart and recited when in good mood.
Now it's about

> Мы объявляем специальную военную операцию
 
Putin's war announcement, or about

> Надо топить украинских детей

crazy talks of Russian propagandists including заклики to drawn Ukrainian children.

Now when I speak with native Russians I paradoxically use English - that's how the "defending of a Russian language" went in Ukraine. Country with the second largest population of Russian speakers is slowly becoming Russian-mute.
